• Week 1: Production-Readiness Baseline

  1. Unify API/socket config.

  - Replace hardcoded URLs in client/src/services/socket.js and client/src/utils/api.js.
  - Keep one socket client only (choose client/src/services/socket.js or client/src/socket.js, then remove the other).
  - Use VITE_API_URL and VITE_SOCKET_URL in Vercel env.

  2. Lock backend CORS/socket origins.

  - Update server/server.js to remove "*" and localhost wildcards in production.
  - Use process.env.CLIENT_URL only for production.

  3. Prepare env templates.

  - Create client/.env.example and complete server/.env.example with all required vars found in code.

  4. Exit criteria.

  - Local dev works with env-only URLs.
  - No localhost hardcoded in client code.

  Week 2: Deploy + Smoke Test

  1. Deploy backend to Render.

  - Service root: server
  - Build: npm install
  - Start: npm start
  - Set all server env vars (MONGO_URI, JWT_SECRET, ADMIN_JWT_SECRET, CLIENT_URL, etc.).

  2. Deploy frontend to Vercel.

  - Project root: client
  - Build: npm run build
  - Set VITE_API_URL + VITE_SOCKET_URL to Render URL.

  3. Production smoke tests.

  - Buyer/seller/admin login flows.
  - Chat send/receive in real time.
  - Notification events.

  4. Exit criteria.

  - End-to-end flows working on public URLs.

  Week 3: File Upload Reliability + Security Hardening

  1. Move uploads off local disk.

  - Replace local server/uploads persistence in chat/requirements flow with Cloudinary or S3.
  - Update server/routes/chatFiles.js and any requirement upload routes.

  2. Security hardening.

  - Tighten rate limits in server/middleware/rateLimit.js.
  - Review auth middleware coverage in server/middleware/auth.js, server/middleware/adminAuth.js.
  - Ensure admin routes require admin token everywhere.

  3. Exit criteria.

  - Files persist after redeploy/restart.
  - No open protected route without auth.

  Week 4: Observability + Crash-Proofing

  1. Add structured logging.

  - Add request IDs and route-level logs in server/server.js.
  - Capture errors with Sentry/Logtail/Render logs.

  2. Add health checks.

  - Add /health endpoint for app + DB connectivity.

  3. Add operational alerts.

  - Alert on 5xx spikes and downtime.

  4. Exit criteria.

  - You can detect and diagnose failures within minutes.

  Week 5: Data + Performance

  1. Index and query tuning.

  - Review Mongo indexes for hot queries in server/models/*.js.
  - Profile chat/history, dashboard, notifications routes.

  2. Pagination limits.

  - Enforce limits on list endpoints (offers, notifications, chat history).

  3. Socket stability.

  - Add reconnect/join verification and duplicate listener cleanup in chat + notification components.

  4. Exit criteria.

  - P95 API latency acceptable under test load.
  - No major memory/socket leak in long sessions.

  Week 6: Launch Execution

  1. Production QA pass.

  - Full role-based checklist: Buyer, Seller, Admin.
  - Browser/device sanity pass.

  2. Business readiness.

  - Privacy policy, terms, support email, incident response doc.

  3. Soft launch.

  - Release to a controlled user set, monitor for 3-5 days.

  4. Public launch.

  - Open registrations and monitor daily metrics.

  5. Exit criteria.

  - Stable first 7 days with no critical incidents.

  Repo-specific “must-fix first” list

  1. client/src/services/socket.js: remove http://localhost:5000 hardcode.
  2. client/src/utils/api.js: remove legacy hardcoded base URL or delete file if unused.
  3. server/server.js: remove permissive CORS/socket wildcard config in production.
  4. server/uploads/*: replace local-disk dependency for production.
  5. Duplicate socket clients (client/src/socket.js and client/src/services/socket.js): consolidate to one.

  If you want, I can convert this into a task board format (owner, estimate, dependency, done-criteria) for direct
  execution.
