Here’s what’s still needed to run the app locally on a laptop for testing, plus how to simulate what you don’t have.
  Local run checklist

  1. Install deps
  - server: npm install

  2. Environment
  - server/.env.development exists already. Confirm:
      - JWT_SECRET, OTP_SECRET, ADMIN_JWT_SECRET are set.
      - FAST2SMS_API_KEY can be empty for dev fallback.


  - Start local MongoDB:
      - mongod (or via Docker/Service)
  4. Redis (required because rate limiter uses Redis)
  - Start Redis:
  - If Redis isn’t running, OTP send rate-limiter will fail.

  5. Start servers

  - Server: npm run dev from server/
  - Client: npm run dev from client/

  Simulation options if missing infra

  - SMS: leave FAST2SMS_API_KEY empty in dev. OTP is logged to server console (fallback).
  - MongoDB: can use a free Atlas connection string temporarily.
  - Redis: if not available, I can add a fallback in dev to in-memory rate limiting (so Redis not required).

  Potential missing pieces to verify

  - Admin auth: test /admin/login with ADMIN_USER/ADMIN_PASS.
  - Socket events: ensure client can connect to server origin; check CORS in server/server.js.
  - Uploads: chat files path requires writable server/uploads and is served.

  If you want, I can:

  1. Add a dev fallback for rate-limiting without Redis.
  2. Add a one-command start:dev root script to run client+server together.
  3. Run a smoke test script on your machine (with your approval).
